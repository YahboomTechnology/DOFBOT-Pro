# DOFBOT Pro 3D Depth Vision Robotic Arm for Jetson NANO 4GB/Orin NANO/Orin NX
![](https://github.com/YahboomTechnology/DOFBOT-Pro/blob/main/DOFBOT-PRO.jpg)
# Introduction
DOFBOT PRO is a desktop-level 3D AI vision robotic arm. Equipped with a series of high-performance hardware such as 3D depth camera, 6-DOF joint, NVIDIA Jetson series board, 10.1-inch touch screen, etc. By integrating ROS robot operating system and forward/inverse kinematics algorithms, the complex motion control of the 6-DOF robotic arm is simplified. We integrate 3D vision technology into robotic arm control to realize depth ranging, shape recognition, height measurement, volume calculation and other functions. Based on these data,DOFBOT PRO can accurately identify, track and grab objects in 3D space. Yahboom provides professional ROS course documents and functional source codes. Whether it is ROS education scenario or technology research and development, this robot can provide higher programmability and computing power, which is an ideal choice.

# Features
* Based on NVIDIA Jetson series boards, Higher computing power, smoother operation
DOFBOT PRO compatible with Jetson NANO 4GB/Jetson Orin NANO/Jetson Orin NX board. The machine learning model is trained through the GPU of Jetson board. Through python programming, adopts deep learning framework, and is jointly developed with MediaPipe to realize AI creative projects such as object image recognition, gesture control, and human posture recognition.
  
* Depth point cloud recognition, gripping in 3D space
Combined with a high-performance 3D depth camera, DOFBOT-PRO can not only realize environmental perception, object recognition and other functions. It can also perform precise 3D space positioning based on the target RGB data, position coordinates and depth information, combined with RGB+D fusion detection, to complete complex visual recognition and grasping tasks.
  
 * 6 DOF structural design design, aluminum alloy material
The entire robotic arm body is made of high-quality aluminum alloy and has six flexible degrees of freedom. Each joint uses a high-precision servo, with faster response speed, can perform smooth multi-axis movements.
  
* Multiple cross-platform remote control methods
DOFBOT PRO supports APP (Just for Android), wireless handle, and PC web page control, allowing you to control the robot as you wish.
