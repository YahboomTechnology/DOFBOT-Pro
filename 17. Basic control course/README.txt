In order to facilitate control, the underlying software of the robotic arm expansion board is developed separately and provides interface calls to control bus servos, PWM servos, and RGB lights.

The relevant underlying driver source code has been packaged into a python library, and the factory image has been installed.

The path of the python library in the factory image is:
~/software/Arm_Lib

Note: The blocks used in the examples in this chapter are 30*30*30mm square blocks.
